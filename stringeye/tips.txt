OpenJDK Client VM warning: TieredCompilation is disabled in this release.
Java compiler not found; Be sure to use java from a JDK
rather than a JRE by modifying PATH or setting JAVA_CMD.


This uses javac to compile a class before calling the clojure compiler.
So needs a cleaner config : to run on fresh LMDE installation.
