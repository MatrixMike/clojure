for lein version 2.7.1 :  {this is from Linux Mint with Leiningen 2.7.1 on Java 1.8.0_121 Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM }
I wanted to do more with testing and now have this new knowledge...

lein new <projname>
cd <projname>
tree -d
cat test/<projname>/core_test.clj 
lein test
 -> observe failing test template even on blank new project

then you could add:   (print "start adding test")
and see your efforts ...
