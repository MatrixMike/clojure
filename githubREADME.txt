I am in the process of learning Clojure - a LISP like language that runs on top of (is hosted by) the JVM (Java Virtual Machine). I came across LISP around 1979 at Newcastle University {NEWC} and subsequently used LISP on a BBC MicroComputer.

These examples started off as code snippets from various tutorials. I have mostly tried then all, found them to be useful for general projects and am now attempting to compile them. The REPL does some automatic stuff and in order, for me, to learn what is automatic and how to get 'standalone' compiled versions to work I am going through the exercise of compiling some snippets with Leiningen. Leiningen Git, Clojure and Java work very nicely together. I use this combination to track my relearning of Java Clojure and Java Interop.

Some examples are trivial at a language level but are/were tricky to compile due to required knowledge of included libraries.

This is a self directed project and has been tremendous fun. I first started to enjoy the interoperation of languages at NEWC with AlgolW and Fortran/Assembler on an IBM 360 mainframe.
